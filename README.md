# dfhack-scripts
A collection of my scripts for DFHack - Dwarf Fortress 47.05

It is recommended to use Lua instead of Ruby when creating new scripts because it handles most of the high level stuff like GUI & easy-to-use API.

Read `findings.md` for object reference cheatsheet.

`advfort_custom.lua` is based on the original `advfort.lua` (under `hack/scripts/gui`) with a custom GUI.

When there's an item blocking a construction, press & hold Esc until the pause menu appears. This is a known bug.
